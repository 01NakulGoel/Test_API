Expect a mix of weight lifting and HIIT (high intensity interval training) that will test your endurance, cardiovascular health, and strength. ",

Week 2 includes three intense workouts split up by body focus — lower body strength, upper body strength, and core/HIIT — with optional recovery workouts and mobility work between. Once you've completed the challenge, we'd love to know which week/format you prefer, for future programs of longer duration that might use this same format! ",

Optional active recovery routines fall between the more intense workouts and include yoga and mobility work to soothe and stretch sore muscles.

Your main workouts are intense, but since there are only three per week, you can focus on maximizing your effort before enjoying some active recovery-style movement the following day. ",

        "overview": "FB Pilates Immersion is a two-week challenge designed to build foundational strength and stability for your entire body. This challenge targets your lower body, core, and upper body with classic and contemporary Pilates exercises. Most of the workouts are low to no impact, isolating your deep stabilizers to build strength and stability from the inside out. However, there are three days in this challenge where you will complete a short Pilates workout before a strength or cardio routine. \n\nPilates, originally called Contrology, was created by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. These mat-based exercises were used to help rehabilitate injured soldiers and veterans. Through Contrology, Joseph Pilates wanted to teach individuals how to use their minds to control their muscles, bring focus to their deep abdominal muscles to create balance within their bodies, and bring awareness to their bodies through breath.\n\nNowadays, there are many different versions of Pilates one could practice, using equipment, apparatuses, or just an exercise mat. Regardless of the type of practice, each exercise follows these nine principles:\n\nBreathing\nConcentration\nControl\nCentering\nFlow\nPostural Alignment\nPrecision\nRelaxation\nStamina\nPilates is not a race, so think quality over quantity. It is essential to move slowly and cautiously with precision and control. In other words, it is better to do five reps with proper form than ten reps with not-so-proper form. If that means moving through a small range of motion, that's okay! As you get stronger and your body gains more stability and control over the movement, you will move through a larger range of motion. \n\nYou will hear the term \"rib-to-hip-connection\" frequently in the Pilates routines. That means that when you engage your abdominals, your lower ribs come closer to your hips or pelvis without rounding or arching your spine. When the ribs and hips are \"connected,\" you are in a neutral spine position. Imagine suspenders on your lower ribs that are attached to the front of your pelvis. If you tighten those suspenders, your rib cage will come down. BUT do not allow your spine to round forward. Keep your spine straight and your chest up tall. If you feel like you are working in opposition here, it is because you are. So, take your time; practice makes perfect. ",
        "format": "Workouts are six days each week, averaging 37 minutes per day, with an average difficulty level of 3 out of 5. Most days are strictly Pilates, but on days 3, 6, and 9, you'll have a Pilates routine AND a cardio or strength routine. You will need an exercise mat, a resistance band, light dumbbells, and a physioball during this challenge. However, if you do not have a physioball, you can opt for an alternative routine; if you do not have light dumbbells, you can use two canned goods. ",
        "methadology": "This challenge is designed for anyone who is new to Pilates and wants to learn more about it as well as those who are already familiar with it and love it. \n\nIf you are taking on this challenge because you enjoy Pilates, use the next 2-weeks to perfect your form, build strength and stability, and celebrate the amazing things your body can do! \n\nIf you are new to Pilates, use this time to switch up your routine, learn new exercises, and connect to your deep stabilizing muscles that aren't usually targeted with traditional strength and cardio.",

Although the lower body muscles are the primary movers during a run, total body strength work is instrumental to injury prevention and enhancing performance. This challenge includes lower body, upper body, core, and low impact/restorative movement workouts, all with exercises that complement the biomechanics of running:\n\nLower Body: Strengthening the muscles of the lower body (with resistance training and plyometrics) improves foot strike force production to improve cadence and minimize turnover effort. \nUpper Body: Your body is a kinetic chain — everything is connected and where your arms go your legs follow (and vice versa). A strong upper body helps you maintain proper running posture as your body fatigues during a run.\nCore: Your core includes more than just your abdominals (glutes, hip flexors, lower back) and is considered the powerhouse from which all movement originates. A stable base creates a foundation for powerful movements in the limbs/extremities.\nLow Impact Cardio/Restorative Movement: Cardio workouts of a lesser intensity than training runs can potentially reduce muscle soreness, offset fatigue, and keep muscles pliable for the next workout session. \nThis challenge is recommended as part of a larger personal regimen that incorporates strength training and cross-training workouts with specific training runs; you can repeat this challenge as needed to accommodate your training goals and preferences. Make sure to build in recovery between repeated rounds to avoid burnout!",
