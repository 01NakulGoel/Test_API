Whether you're too busy for more than three workouts per week, or you like to supplement other types of fitness (walking, swimming, etc.) with at-home workout videos, this challenge is intended to help support a well-rounded fitness routine that suits your desired schedule and pace. Expect a mix of weight lifting and HIIT (high intensity interval training) that will test your endurance, cardiovascular health, and strength. ",
      "format": "The format for this challenge varies from week to week. Week 1 includes three intense total body workouts with optional active recovery workouts and mobility work between. Week 2 includes three intense workouts split up by body focus — lower body strength, upper body strength, and core/HIIT — with optional recovery workouts and mobility work between. Once you've completed the challenge, we'd love to know which week/format you prefer, for future programs of longer duration that might use this same format! ",
      "methadology": "This workout challenge includes a blend of strength training and HIIT — sometimes in the same workout — with a Level 3 to Level 4 difficulty. Optional active recovery routines fall between the more intense workouts and include yoga and mobility work to soothe and stretch sore muscles. The average time commitment for the required workouts is about 45 minutes. Your main workouts are intense, but since there are only three per week, you can focus on maximizing your effort before enjoying some active recovery-style movement the following day. ",
      "equipments": "While all the workouts in this challenge can be done with bodyweight only, we recommend having a pair of dumbbells (especially for the multiple strength training workouts included). We also recommend an optional mat. ",

      "format": "This challenge is ideal for nearly everyone! However, you should have some experience with foundational bodyweight movements — like squats and push-ups — and/or a solid base of strength before starting. Many exercises within the cardio and HIIT routines involve explosive movements that may be challenging for some who struggle with high impact activity. If you suffer from chronic back pain, this may not be the challenge for you.",
      "methadology": "The Challenge progresses from Level 3 difficulty in the first week to Level 4 and 5 in the second week, with workouts that range from 25–45 minutes in length (averaging out to 34 minutes a day). This way, you can be sure your body can maximize each workout while still effectively recovering between them. Feel free to use our \"reschedule\" feature to rework your calendar in any way you need to accomplish this challenge. ",

      "overview": "FB Pilates Immersion is a two-week challenge designed to build foundational strength and stability for your entire body. This challenge targets your lower body, core, and upper body with classic and contemporary Pilates exercises. Most of the workouts are low to no impact, isolating your deep stabilizers to build strength and stability from the inside out. However, there are three days in this challenge where you will complete a short Pilates workout before a strength or cardio routine. \n\nPilates, originally called Contrology, was created by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. These mat-based exercises were used to help rehabilitate injured soldiers and veterans. Through Contrology, Joseph Pilates wanted to teach individuals how to use their minds to control their muscles, bring focus to their deep abdominal muscles to create balance within their bodies, and bring awareness to their bodies through breath.\n\nNowadays, there are many different versions of Pilates one could practice, using equipment, apparatuses, or just an exercise mat. Regardless of the type of practice, each exercise follows these nine principles:\n\nBreathing\nConcentration\nControl\nCentering\nFlow\nPostural Alignment\nPrecision\nRelaxation\nStamina\nPilates is not a race, so think quality over quantity. It is essential to move slowly and cautiously with precision and control. In other words, it is better to do five reps with proper form than ten reps with not-so-proper form. If that means moving through a small range of motion, that's okay! As you get stronger and your body gains more stability and control over the movement, you will move through a larger range of motion. \n\nYou will hear the term \"rib-to-hip-connection\" frequently in the Pilates routines. That means that when you engage your abdominals, your lower ribs come closer to your hips or pelvis without rounding or arching your spine. When the ribs and hips are \"connected,\" you are in a neutral spine position. Imagine suspenders on your lower ribs that are attached to the front of your pelvis. If you tighten those suspenders, your rib cage will come down. BUT do not allow your spine to round forward. Keep your spine straight and your chest up tall. If you feel like you are working in opposition here, it is because you are. So, take your time; practice makes perfect. ",
      "format": "Workouts are six days each week, averaging 37 minutes per day, with an average difficulty level of 3 out of 5. Most days are strictly Pilates, but on days 3, 6, and 9, you'll have a Pilates routine AND a cardio or strength routine. You will need an exercise mat, a resistance band, light dumbbells, and a physioball during this challenge. However, if you do not have a physioball, you can opt for an alternative routine; if you do not have light dumbbells, you can use two canned goods. ",
      "methadology": "This challenge is designed for anyone who is new to Pilates and wants to learn more about it as well as those who are already familiar with it and love it. \n\nIf you are taking on this challenge because you enjoy Pilates, use the next 2-weeks to perfect your form, build strength and stability, and celebrate the amazing things your body can do! \n\nIf you are new to Pilates, use this time to switch up your routine, learn new exercises, and connect to your deep stabilizing muscles that aren't usually targeted with traditional strength and cardio.",

Although the lower body muscles are the primary movers during a run, total body strength work is instrumental to injury prevention and enhancing performance. This challenge includes lower body, upper body, core, and low impact/restorative movement workouts, all with exercises that complement the biomechanics of running:\n\nLower Body: Strengthening the muscles of the lower body (with resistance training and plyometrics) improves foot strike force production to improve cadence and minimize turnover effort. \nUpper Body: Your body is a kinetic chain — everything is connected and where your arms go your legs follow (and vice versa). A strong upper body helps you maintain proper running posture as your body fatigues during a run.\nCore: Your core includes more than just your abdominals (glutes, hip flexors, lower back) and is considered the powerhouse from which all movement originates. A stable base creates a foundation for powerful movements in the limbs/extremities.\nLow Impact Cardio/Restorative Movement: Cardio workouts of a lesser intensity than training runs can potentially reduce muscle soreness, offset fatigue, and keep muscles pliable for the next workout session. \nThis challenge is recommended as part of a larger personal regimen that incorporates strength training and cross-training workouts with specific training runs; you can repeat this challenge as needed to accommodate your training goals and preferences. Make sure to build in recovery between repeated rounds to avoid burnout!",

This is an 8-week beginner-friendly program designed to build your base of total body strength, cardiovascular endurance, and all-around fitness. \n\nThis program is ideal for anyone new to exercising consistently, as well as those restarting exercise after an injury or workout break. FB Reboot will not only improve your fitness, but boost your confidence and help you gain lasting consistency with your workouts.",
      "format": "Over the course of 8 weeks, you’ll progressively build from level 1 & 2 workouts to level 3, 4 and 5 workouts. You’ll find that the workout frequency (or number of workouts per week) also increases as the weeks go on, to keep your body stimulated and fitness level progressing. This strategy allows you to approach fitness in a smart way that will help you establish consistency and confidence over time — without risking injury.",
      "methadology": "So you can be sure your body is getting everything it needs to be well-rounded, you'll complete a range of workout styles: strength training, HIIT, low-impact cardio, core, pilates, and flexibility. Your trainers are a team of Certified Personal Trainers and Doctors of Physical Therapy: Kelli, Daniel, Tasha, Kayla, Amanda, Nicole and Marina. This program was built and written by Nicole and is included with an active Plus Membership or Plus Pass.",
      "equipments": "You can technically do many of these workouts with only bodyweight, but dumbbells are very helpful for increasing challenge and strength. We’ve tried to minimize the use of additional equipment, but there may be cases where resistance bands and an exercise step (or stair) may also make appearances in this program (in these cases, alternate workouts that use only dumbbells are also provided). We also recommend an optional exercise mat for many of these workouts. ",
      "trainer": " FB Reboot includes a daily guide that walks you through the program every step of the way; it also includes featured articles from Doctors of Physical Therapy, Certified Personal Trainers, Doctoral-Level Mental Health Professionals, and Registered Dietitians (Meet the Fitness Blender Team).",

      "overview": "FB Strong Runner is a two-week challenge designed to help runners improve their running pace and form with supplemental strength-focused workouts. Although the lower body muscles are the primary movers during a run, total body strength work is instrumental to injury prevention and enhancing performance. This challenge includes lower body, upper body, core, and low impact/restorative movement workouts, all with exercises that complement the biomechanics of running:\n\nLower Body: Strengthening the muscles of the lower body (with resistance training and plyometrics) improves foot strike force production to improve cadence and minimize turnover effort. \nUpper Body: Your body is a kinetic chain — everything is connected and where your arms go your legs follow (and vice versa). A strong upper body helps you maintain proper running posture as your body fatigues during a run.\nCore: Your core includes more than just your abdominals (glutes, hip flexors, lower back) and is considered the powerhouse from which all movement originates. A stable base creates a foundation for powerful movements in the limbs/extremities.\nLow Impact Cardio/Restorative Movement: Cardio workouts of a lesser intensity than training runs can potentially reduce muscle soreness, offset fatigue, and keep muscles pliable for the next workout session. \nThis challenge is recommended as part of a larger personal regimen that incorporates strength training and cross-training workouts with specific training runs; you can repeat this challenge as needed to accommodate your training goals and preferences. Make sure to build in recovery between repeated rounds to avoid burnout!",
      "format": "Workouts are six days each week, average 32 minutes per day, and are mostly level 3 workouts to allow for enough energy to complete the optional runs on days 2, 5, 8, 9, and 12. For most of the workouts, you’ll need a set of weights (or two) and a mat, but a handful of workouts include optional equipment (such as the physio-ball, exercise band, and yoga blocks). ",

If you suffer from chronic back pain, this may not be the challenge for you.",
      "methadology": "With many of our kettlebell workouts being a level 4 or 5 out of 5, we’ve designed this challenge with 3 “required” kettlebell workouts per week and 2 “optional” workouts per week that will be of a recovery nature. This way, you can be sure your body can maximize each workout, while effectively recovering between them. You’ll also find a couple days where you get to choose between 2 workouts based on how you’re feeling that day. Feel free to rework your calendar in any way you need to accomplish this challenge. ",
      "equipments": "For this challenge, you’ll need one main thing: kettlebells! Most of the workouts require using just one kettlebell at a time, but we recommend having a few weight options available, if possible. While we encourage kettlebell use, we know this may not be accessible to everyone. Dumbbells make a good substitute for most exercises.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll come across a workout using a jump rope. If you don’t have one, you can repeat the same motions without a jump rope.",

These workouts can absolutely make you look great, but we want you to also feel great. Our aim is to guide you to move well, and live well. We want you to feel strong and capable, energetic and able to live easily in your own body.",

However, that could increase the risk of injury and/or burnout.",

Over the course of 2 weeks, we'll gradually increase the intensity and time commitment from shorter (~25 min) level 2 workouts to slightly longer (~40 min) level 3 workouts, allowing you to gradually build back into a consistent routine without shocking your system. There are 5 workouts per week with an optional bonus day, plus extra credit workouts included throughout.",

Since it may have been a while since you last exercised consistently, you may find some roadblocks (physically or mentally). If you miss a workout, simply reschedule it without letting it mean you have failed the program. There is no such thing as failure with FB Reboot (or any program, for that matter). You're here for a reason and we're cheering you on every step of the way!",
